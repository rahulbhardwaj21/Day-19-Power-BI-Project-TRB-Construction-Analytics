Use Power BI to enhance the construction Process

üèóÔ∏è Day 19 of My Daily Project Challenge: Power BI for TRB Construction! üèóÔ∏è

Excited to unveil my latest project: TRB Construction Analytics with Power BI! This unique project addresses critical challenges in real estate, construction, highway, and infrastructure sectors by providing comprehensive quality, planning, risk, and safety reports.

Key Highlights:
Comprehensive Reporting: Delivers quality control, planning, risk, and safety reports to ensure top-notch construction standards.
Data-Driven Insights: Created a model connecting multiple datasets to uncover hidden patterns in construction data, enhancing decision-making.
Quality Control: Focuses on maintaining the highest construction quality, the cornerstone of any successful project.
Project Planning: Tracks actual vs. planned activities, ensuring timely project completion‚Äîbeneficial for both clients and contractors.
Risk & Safety Management: Monitors risk and safety measures to safeguard workers and engineers on-site.
Advanced Dashboards: Developed four separate dashboards for quality control, risk management, planning, and an overarching main dashboard using Power BI and DAX queries.
This project exemplifies how data analytics can revolutionize the construction industry by improving quality, safety, and efficiency.
